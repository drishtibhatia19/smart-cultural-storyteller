# Smart Cultural Storyteller

## Project Overview
Smart Cultural Storyteller is an AI-driven system designed to generate culturally rich, contextual stories using structured prompts and machine learning techniques. The project aims to demonstrate how AI can be used responsibly to preserve, narrate, and explore cultural narratives.

This repository contains the **primary evaluation artifact**: a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that serves as the single source of truth for the project.

## Problem Definition & Objective

### Problem Statement
Cultural stories, traditions, and historical narratives are often fragmented, inaccessible, or lost over time. There is a need for intelligent systems that can assist in generating culturally contextualized stories while maintaining ethical and responsible AI practices.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a system that:
- Generates culturally relevant stories based on structured inputs
- Demonstrates end-to-end AI system design
- Ensures transparency, reproducibility, and ethical considerations

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smart-cultural-storyteller.git
cd smart-cultural-storyteller
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open and run the notebook:
```
Smart_Cultural_Storyteller.ipynb
```

👉 **Run all cells top-to-bottom**. The notebook is designed to execute without errors when run sequentially.

## Evaluation Notes (For Reviewers)
- The `.ipynb` notebook is the **primary source of truth**
- All sections required by the evaluation rubric are included inside the notebook
- No manual configuration is required beyond installing dependencies
- Generated outputs (if any) are created automatically during execution

---

## Ethical Considerations & Responsible AI
This project acknowledges potential risks associated with generative AI, including bias, cultural misrepresentation, and misuse. Ethical safeguards and responsible AI practices are discussed explicitly within the notebook.

---

## Conclusion & Future Scope
Future enhancements may include:
- Integration with larger cultural datasets
- Multilingual story generation
- Human-in-the-loop validation for cultural accuracy
